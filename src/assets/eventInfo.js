The session provided a safe, controlled environment for students to get their hands dirty with industry-standard tools like Kali Linux, Metasploit, and Burp Suite. Participants moved beyond theory to simulate real-world attacks—such as SQL injection and Man-in-the-Middle exploits—to understand exactly how systems are compromised. By dissecting these vulnerabilities, the workshop effectively demonstrated that the best way to defend a system is to understand how to break it.",
